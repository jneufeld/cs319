      <div>
        <h2 id="risk1">We don't get an accurate statement of requirements</h2>
        <p>
        <strong>Description</strong>:
        After meeting with the client we are still unsure or unaware of many of the
        project requirements. We don't have a good idea or solid foundation to work on.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Probability</strong>: 3 (may happen)</p>
        <p><strong>Impact</strong>: 4 (serious impact)</p>

        <p>
        <strong>Mitigation</strong>:
        Plan for the meeting with the client to ensure we get the information we need.
        Put time into coming up with what we need to ask and how we need to ask it.
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>Contingency</strong>:
        Schedule our second client meeting as soon as possible, and learn from our
        mistakes with the first meeting so that we thoroughly prepare for it.
        </p>

      <div>
        <h2 id="risk2">The client doesn't reply</h2>
        <p>
        <strong>Description</strong>:
        The client may not respond to our initial email for a number of days, putting
        us behind with respect to time.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Probability</strong>: 3 (may happen)</p>
        <p><strong>Impact</strong>: 1 (little impact)</p>

        <p>
        <strong>Mitigation</strong>:
        Reply to the client as soon as possible when we're able.
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>Contingency</strong>:
        If the client has not responded, send a new email or a gentle reminder.

      <div>
        <h2 id="risk3">Not all team members are able to attend a meeting due to coop/work interviews</h2>
        <p>
        <strong>Description</strong>:
        As some team members are looking for their summer term co-op jobs, they will
        be required to go on interviews on a short notice. These interviews may cause
        them to miss team meetings which may cause some communication issues.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Probability</strong>: 3 (may happen)</p>
        <p><strong>Impact</strong>: </p>

        <p>
        <strong>Mitigation</strong>:
        Find multiple meeting times for the team during the week. If no other time
        works, the member who will not be attending the meeting must send out a full
        review of their work and what they must say; as the agenda will be sent out
        prior to the meeting, the member must also comment on the agenda items to
        make sure their opinion is heard.
        </p>
